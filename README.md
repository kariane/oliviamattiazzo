My name is Olivia Mattiazzo and I'm a backend developer who loves Microsoft techonologies. I'm also a writer in my [personal tech blog](https://oliviamattiazzo.dev/) and a PokÃ©mon illustrator on [my Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/oliviasarts/).

In my free time, I like to draw, to knit, to play videogames, to read and to play ukulele. Not necessarily in this order :sweat_smile:

## Status

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on sharpening and evolving my .NET skills so I can become the senior developer I always wanted to be.
- ðŸŒ± I'm also learning more about Javascript, because I kinda enjoy the language, even though I'm not so good coding with it (yet!)
- ðŸ˜„ My pronouns are she / her.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I really love learning new idioms! I already speak my native Portuguese, a fluent English, a intermediate Spanish and I have some fundaments of German (it's my next objective, btw)
